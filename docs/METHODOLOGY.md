# Methodology (v0.1)

Entropia evaluates claims using diagnostic signals rather than verdicts.

## Claim Extraction
- Identify sentences asserting origin, attribution, authority, or existence
- No semantic interpretation beyond explicit claims

## Evidence Mapping
- Extract cited sources and outbound references
- Classify sources by authority tier:
  - Tier 1: Primary (laws, statutes, academic papers)
  - Tier 2: Reputable secondary (encyclopedias, major publishers)
  - Tier 3: Tertiary (blogs, tourism sites, unsourced claims)

## Signals Evaluated
- Evidence coverage
- Source authority balance
- Freshness and staleness
- Conflict between equally supported claims
- Presence of unsupported assertions

## Index Calculation
Indices are illustrative and diagnostic.
They represent relative support, not correctness.

All scoring logic will remain documented and modifiable.
