# Entropia

Entropia is an open-source diagnostic tool for detecting entropy, decay,
and support gaps in public claims.

It does **not** determine what is true, correct, legal, authentic, or valid.

Entropia evaluates how well claims are supported by available, current,
and authoritative sources, and highlights conflicts, gaps, and drift
between claims and evidence.

---

## What Entropia Does

- Extracts factual and attributional claims from public artifacts
- Maps claims to cited sources
- Evaluates evidence quality, freshness, and consistency
- Detects conflict, decay, and unsupported assertions
- Produces transparent, explainable reports

---

## What Entropia Does NOT Do

- Decide which claim is correct
- Resolve disputes
- Judge subjective qualities (taste, preference, morality)
- Provide legal, medical, or professional advice
- Replace domain experts

Entropia is a **mirror**, not an oracle.

## v0.1 Scope

- Single-page analysis
- Public web artifacts only
- Origin, attribution, and authority-related claims
- Transparent scoring (no hidden logic)
- Artifact-based reports committed to the repository

---

## Included Artifacts

| Artifact | Focus |
|--------|------|
| Laksa Origin | Cultural attribution dispute |
| UK Common-law Marriage | Legal misconception |
| Wikipedia Misconceptions | High-noise claim environment |

Each artifact contains:
- Source context
- Extracted claims
- Evidence mapping
- Support and entropy signals

---

## Project Status

This repository currently contains **manual v0.1 artifacts**.
Automation, parsers, and CLI tooling will follow.

The goal of v0.1 is to validate the methodology, not to optimize execution.
