# Entropia – Core Principles

## 1. Non-Normative
Entropia does not assert truth or correctness.
It evaluates support, not reality itself.

## 2. Evidence-First
Only publicly visible evidence is considered.
No private data. No inference about intent.

## 3. Transparent
Every score, signal, and warning must be explainable.

## 4. Symmetric
The same evaluation rules apply to all domains and sources.

## 5. Decay-Aware
Staleness, citation rot, and drift are first-class signals.

## 6. Responsibility
Interpretation and action remain the responsibility of the user.
